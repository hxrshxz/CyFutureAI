# Solana Integration Troubleshooting

## Current Status
The app is configured to gracefully handle Solana RPC issues and fall back to demo mode.

## Recent Fixes Applied

### 1. Multiple RPC Endpoints
- Primary: Ankr RPC (https://rpc.ankr.com/solana_devnet)
- Fallback: Official Solana (https://api.devnet.solana.com)
- Backup: Sonic Game (https://devnet.sonic.game)

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Balance check failures â†’ Demo mode
- Connection timeouts â†’ Demo mode  
- JSON-RPC errors â†’ Demo mode
- Transaction failures â†’ Demo mode

### 3. User Experience
- Clear progress messages
- Specific error explanations
- Always functional (demo mode as fallback)

## How It Works Now

1. **Wallet Connected + SOL Available**: Real Solana transaction
2. **Wallet Connected + No SOL**: Demo mode (with airdrop option)
3. **No Wallet**: Demo mode
4. **RPC Issues**: Demo mode (with clear error message)

## For Users

The app will work regardless of network issues. You'll see:
- âœ… **Success**: Real transaction with Solana Explorer link
- âš¡ **Demo**: Simulated transaction (still shows the functionality)

## IPFS Integration

- âœ… **Configured**: Pinata JWT token is set
- âœ… **Working**: Should upload and provide IPFS links
- ðŸ”— **Access**: Files accessible via gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/HASH

## Testing Instructions

1. Visit: http://localhost:5174/
2. Upload invoice image
3. Try both storage options:
   - Solana: Will attempt real transaction or fall back to demo
   - IPFS: Should work with Pinata integration

The app is now robust and user-friendly!
