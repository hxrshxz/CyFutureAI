CyFuture AI: Decentralized Invoice Processing
CyFuture AI is a next-generation financial processing platform that leverages Artificial Intelligence, decentralized storage (IPFS), and the Solana blockchain to offer a secure, transparent, and intelligent way to manage invoices.

We transform unstructured invoices into structured, verifiable data, secured with an immutable on-chain record. Our platform not only automates data entry but also provides an AI-powered assistant to derive meaningful insights from your financial documents.

✨ Key Features
AI-Powered Data Extraction: Upload any invoice (PDF or image), and our Google Gemini-powered vision model will intelligently parse and extract key information like invoice number, vendor, total amount, and date.

Decentralized Storage: Every uploaded invoice and its extracted data is stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) via Pinata, ensuring your documents are tamper-proof, censorship-resistant, and always accessible.

Blockchain-Verified Transactions: Each processed invoice generates a unique transaction on the Solana Devnet. This transaction includes the IPFS hash, creating an immutable, publicly verifiable proof of the document's existence and its processed state.

Interactive Dashboard: A clean and modern interface to view key financial stats, manage the invoice processing queue, and track the status of each document from upload to blockchain confirmation.


Conversational AI Accountant: Chat with your data! Our AI assistant can answer questions, summarize expenses, and provide insights based on the invoices you've processed.

Multi-Language and Voice Support: Interact with the AI assistant using typed commands or voice in multiple languages, including English, Hindi, and more.
